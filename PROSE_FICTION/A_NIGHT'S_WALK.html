<meta name="description" content="This blog is going to put the concept of completeness for the analysis and we will get an insight on how weird this concept is and how it represents itself in our daily life and how it is just a fallacy or not? What do we really mean by completeness? Is there anything like that? Does it delude us on various fronts of our life? I am going to take various examples from material to immaterial or metaphysical.  Lets scrutinize the word without any bias and understand much better that we don’t really mean, what we say in our common daily lives because we don’t even know what we are saying.

<p align="left">
The wound of aloneness gets disrupted from healing just like this. In the crowd when mind turns to
introspection and the self-reflection commences, I become alien in an alien world. I rush to isolate
myself from the world, from every possible affliction of thought, for a wish to know the essence of
being is born. I yearn for night and as the veil of day sinks with the sun, phantoms rise from my decadent
soul. Blinded by the veil of day till now, a new world presents itself, the canopy of stars ask me to
question, to look beyond and now that it’s time to actually look both inside and outside, I turn to
retrospection and fill myself with the guilt of being late. Is it too late to look above? Is it too late
ponder over the questions?
</p>

<p align="left">
This wound of aloneness is disrupted by the exertion of alienation. With alienation comes
detachment, detachment from everything and this leads to isolation. These all trigger each other and
a new personality and identity is born. The route of conscience changes as the perspective changes.
The meanings change and just like this I change. The decaying soul gets the panacea and revives
itself from the depths leaving the residual beads of agony. These beads roll over my cheeks and rush
to the ground. How can the most painful of moments be enlightening at the same time? The moonlit
surroundings and the impression of world’s madness in my eyes mingle and turn into poison.
</p>



<p align="left">
A moonlit night’s walk is special in many ways. A train of thoughts in my mind embark it’s journey
moving through the hazy sky and I find myself standing on the terrace of an unknown building
witnessing the demise of twilight. Scarlet west counting its last moments and clouds canopying the
south east sky accompanied by the eastern darkness move to seize the time from day. Cool breeze of
spring from north brings message of night and trees laden with vibrant blossoms begin to fade into
indistinct contours and like this uncanny beauty of night is born. The mundane beauty becomes
discrete giving space to a transparent beauty which evolves within. At this serene moment I take a
sigh which further takes me to deserted lands where once life existed, where the strongest got
perished. Nothing left but dissipated screams which cannot be heard now, the precarious nature of
life reminds me of the strongest of empires which thrived long ago. I treasure those unheard
screams and bring myself to the present.
</p>



<p align="left">
This train always terminates its journey at the present and I am left with the friendly stars and
hostile emotions churning inside me. I take some time off and contrive to appreciate the colorless
beauty of transparency. The wound of aloneness at this time begins to heal itself with the
understanding of transient tendency of universe.
</p>




<p align="left">
Just when I deem it’s the terminal of the track various other tracks appear each going in different
direction. The grey clouds in sky stir my imagination and I start another journey which takes me
through bizarre landscapes.
</p>




<p align="left">
My first visit is to the garden of cherry blossoms. A landscape filled with intoxicating beauty of life.
Under the azure sky I spread my hands in awe and look at this treat for sore eyes. The healing of
soul again leaves a bead of agony which renews the wound of aloneness and all the trees disappear
from my world of fancy leaving barren land behind. In distraught I move here and there in search of
beauty but to no avail. Tired and disappointed I take refuge on the barren land and sit there lost but
soon winds of terror and loss surround me and phantoms rise from ground. Sun in the far west starts
burning like a paper and disappears leaving darkness and friendly stars behind. I smile, for crying
makes as much sense at this time. The biting cold brings me back to the present again leaving me in
wonder.
</p>




<p align="left">
The night’s walk ends with more questions. These questions vividly appear as the moonlight tries to
lull me to sleepiness. I bid goodbye to the nightsky with a smile and sleep with utmost carelessness.
The phantoms rarely trouble me in sleep. I always know that tranquility will wrap me in sleep. A
thin layer of difference appears as a solution. On one side is caring about things and on the other
side appears careless flowing with the breeze of life. I always choose former and to curb the
torments I never become oblivious of the latter.
</p>




<p align="left">
Life is vast and can’t be encapsulated into something objective. It might seem absurd and
meaningless at times but life’s free from obligations and so is whole universe, the human tendency
to sort everything and order everything is just an appealing mirage. I love this mirage, for it drives
my imagination. Though, aware of the inevitable present I cling to my imaginary world, for its
richer and beyond affliction.
