<p>Hello! Dear vistor. My name is Divyanshu and I am currently a student. And like many people, I like exploring a lot. I like doing many things and as an introvert it becomes really easy to share the likes, dislikes and other things via the website. </p>
<p>I like dreaming a lot and fantasizing about stuff. I am an amateur writer so forgive me for the peculiarly written stuff. I have many interests, some of them are reading, writing, coding (just web development for now) and I am currently working on <a href="https://getstudymaterial.github.io">GetStudyMaterial</a> and <a href="https://gsssbangana.githhub.io">GSSSBangana</a> website. I like playing Chess and Sudoku too.  <a href="https://lichess.org/@/divyanshusharma27"><b>Play chess with me.</b> </a></p>
<p>Out of all subjects, I like History, Psychology, Philosophy, Sociology and Science most. This website is just for sharing the creative works of mine and the works that I like. I like fancing about weird concepts a lot especially the extreme conditions and the Short Stories clearly reflect that.</p>
