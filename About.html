<p>Hello! Dear vistor. My name is Divyanshu and I am currently a student. And like many people, I like exploring a lot. I like doing many things and as an introvert it becomes really easy to share the likes, dislikes and other things via the website. </p>
<p>I like dreaming a lot and fantasizing about stuff. I am an amateur writer so forgive me for the peculiarly written stuff. I have many interests, some of them are reading, writing, coding (just web development for now) I like playing Chess and Sudoku too </p>
<p>Out of all subjects, I like History, Psychology, Philosophy, Sociology, Science most. The website is just for sharing the creative works of mine and the works that I like. There’s book library where you can find the books I’ve read and the books which are in my bucket list. You can also download those for free.</p>
<p> I like fancing about weird concepts a lot, so there’s a Short Stories section for the original Stories I’ve written. I like reading a lot and writing Stories is just a symptom of that. The Poetry section contains both originals and the poems from my favourite poets. I like composing poems but I am not that good because I am just a newbie.</p>
<p> I have had many adventures till now. I am young but still I have had many in the last few years. 
I like to imagine the extreme conditions, the stories clearly reflect that. </p>
