  <summary>  <u>Springing Love</u> </summary>
			     
<font face="Lato" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">
<p>My dear, spring has come,</p>
<p>nature is yet again youthful,</p>
<p>prettiest flowers are blooming,</p>
<p>and even the bees are singing.</p>
<br>
<p>The nights are peaceful,</p>
<p>I like these, even cuckoo does</p>
<p>cuckoo praises these nights</p>
<p>but in his own manner.</p>
<br>
<p>He tells all the secrets</p>
<p>secrets that only lovers can understand</p>
<p>secrets of youth, love and beyond</p>
<p>secrets of spring ans springing love</p>
<br>
<p>Last night was cold and calm</p>
<p>and the cuckoo was sharing the secrets out loud</p>
<p>and here I share it with you</p>
<br>
<p>Love dwells in innocent hearts,</p>
<p>It dies with logic</p>
<p>love dwells in young hearts,</p>
<p>It dies with maturity.</p>
<br>
<p>It never matures,</p>
<p>It’s sole fate is death after youth</p>
<p>don’t let it mature,</p>
<p>don’t let it die.</p>
<br>
<p>That’s what he said</p>
<p>and then I imagined you</p>
<br>
<p>The uncanny countenance, </p>
<p>The smiling eyes</p>
<p>and the lips velvety</p>
<p>which speak sweetest when mute</p>
<br>
<p>A benevolent character,</p>
<p>and a witty mind</p>
<p>with an innocent heart</p>
<p>playful and happy</p>
<br>
<p>Your presence can’t match anything else</p>
<br>
<p>The peace that comes with you,</p>
<p>no night can offer that</p>
<p>The charm that you possess,</p>
<p>no spring can offer that</p>
<br>
<p>words become trivial, </p>
<p>when describing you</p>
<p>a single kiss of yours </p>
<p>can dash all the poetry.</p>

<p> And it’s a promise,</p>
<p>I will meet you beyond garden</p>

<p>A distant memory keeps calling me,</p>

<p>about a dream on lease</p>
<p>a dream of seas.</p>
<br>
<p>Seas meeting at one point,</p>
<p>not one, two or three,</p>
<p>but millions and countless</p>
<p>each one representing me</p>
<br>
<p>Each one colored differently,</p>
<p>each one having differences,</p>
<p>each one contradicting the other,</p>
<p>each one filling the same container.</p>
<br>
<p>But I can’t imagine the dimensions</p>
<p>dimensions of the container,</p>
<p>still I am sure it isn’t huge</p>
<p>it is small albeit can’t be filled</p>
<br>
<p>A distant memory keeps calling me,</p>
<p>It keeps reminding me,</p>
<p>about a dream on lease,</p>
<p>A dream trying to appease.</p>
