<font face="Lato" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">
<p>Oh, you came in my life,</p>
<p>Just like that butterfly in garden</p>
<p>You appealed to me,</p>
<p>Just like that butterfly in garden</p>
<p>You made me follow you,</p>
<p>Just like that butterfly in garden</p>
<p>You left me, </p>
<p>Just like that butterfly in garden</p>
<br>
<p>But I remember you, </p>
<p>Prisoned in my memory</p>
<br>
<p>I wish to tell you</p>
<br>
<p>The charm you have,</p>
<p>Just like that butterfly in garden</p>
<p> The elegance you hold,</p>
<p> Just like that butterfly in garden</p>
<p>The power of bewitching you have,</p>
<p>Just like that butterfly in garden</p>
<br>
<p>I received you with the greatest joy,</p>
<p>You left me with littlest concern</p>
<p>But you’ll remain love of mine,</p>
<p>Unlike that butterfly in garden</p>
<p>My love will never fade away,</p>
<p> Unlike that butterfly in garden</p>
<br>
<p> And it’s a promise,</p>
<p>I will meet you beyond garden</p>
