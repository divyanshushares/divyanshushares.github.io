<h2> Introduction... <h2>
<p>I wrote a blog last year<i> A short existential journey</i> which was incoherent because it was written poorly. It did shed a faint light on the feelings, though. My first bad trip of existential questions happened more than 2 years ago. I started reading philosophical literature back then, it wasn’t a pleasant experience overall. It was enlightening but not pleasant. The hopeless optimistic philosophy didn’t get me, it was the hopeful pesssimistic philosophy which got me and I still avoid reading philosophers who think life is gay and bright. I thought “this shall also pass”, thoughts did become less frequent but they still persist and I welcome them every month, sometimes once in a couple of months. They aren’t often intense now but act as reminders which ruin the happiest moments everytime. They are generally bad even if not intense. </p>



<p>  The intrusive questions which I neither love nor hate but are close to me, take me again and again to the trips of illusive night of existence. Moving on from those questions is simply impossible. The time comes when butterfly feels like covering itself with cocoon again. The Dusk settles itself and I become alien in the unknown world, waiting for the dawn. The dusk brings night telling me that I am wrong to condemn it, the night is much worse. Night is a consented vehement persecution which covers the mind with the blanket of gloom and I wait for the Dawn. I don’t want the night because it is lonesome and cold but I don’t want day either because it is awful and deluding by nature, it gives me and probably all of us false hopes. Night in no way is less deluding, the moon takes away all the attention, it makes it hard to focus on darkness, eyes too, looking for light saving me from the dark truth for survival. The desperate effort to find light in the darkness never ends, all because there’s nothing to look at in the complete darkness and that’s the reason we are always allured by light.</p>
