<p>This blog is going to put the concept of completeness for the analysis and we will get an insight on how weird this concept is and how it represents itself in our daily life and if it is just a fallacy or not? What do we really mean by completeness? Is there anything like that? Does it delude us on various fronts of our life? I am going to take various examples from material to immaterial or metaphysical.  Let's scrutinize the word without any bias and understand much better that we don’t really mean, what we say in our common daily lives because we don’t even know what we are saying.  

<h2> What is completeness?</h2>
<p>The question seems very stupid at first look but on giving it a thought it really starts seeming like a question with a great scope. What do we mean when we say the word complete? Let's have an example with the sentence having the word complete in it. a) Sudha was in a complete oblivion. In sentence a) we see that it refers that Sudha had forgotten everything. Let's take out “complete oblivion” from it. What is “complete oblivion”? In simple terms it meant that sudha had forgotten everything. Or complete forgetfulness. Can we really forget everything?  There seems no actual way to figure out that on earth, if Sudha forgot everything or not. The sentence is exaggerating the condition of Sudha perhaps. Still let's assume if that was possible, that Sudha forgot everything completely but did sudha really remember anything at all before that condition? The preceding concept of the “Sudha” isn’t complete in itself. What is a complete person? There are limits that make a physical body of human a human but is human in itself complete? Are you and I complete? We’ll get back to Sudha’s condition later.

<h2> Is there anything complete?</h2>
<p>Well, the question above is potent enough to answer the former question of, "What is completeness?". So let's start from the numbers at first. Are numbers complete? Can you count and complete the numbers? Obviously, no. Nobody can do it because the concept goes to the unending infinty. The concept of completeness seems abstract. You can argue here that numbers in themselves are abstract concept. In that manner actually everything is abstract in its essence. Isn’t it? Is the universe complete? If yes then where is it going? The completeness would’ve provided it the stability to not expand further. Is the matter in universe complete? We can’t really know that. But we can be sure that it is enough to make the universe survive. </p>
<p>Let's come to the daily lives. Are we complete? If yes then why do we need things for our survival, why are there urges and cravings? Is body just trying to complete itself? And if food is the answer for the complete body then why did organisms evolve? Let's take a human for the sake of understanding it better. Basic needs or urges are necessary to be fulfilled but our urges never end there and it isn’t because of the modern world. Desires may have exapnded with the time but it isn’t like it was absent in the past. If that would’ve been the case then we couldn’t have reached this stage of expanded desires. </p>
<p>Let's take an apple. An apple can be whole but cannot be complete. We can never know what a complete apple is because there is no such thing. We can limit it to some extent, say that an apple with this much roughage and nutrients is complete but then what about the apple with more of those things? More than complete? So it really seems that completeness is something abstract or perhaps ideal state which we can never possess. </p>


<h2> Relating the first and the second question...</h2>
<p>So, the second question makes us realize that completeness is utterly an abstract concept or term. It cannot be reached ever because it is something ideal. So when the sentence was put that “Sudha was in a complete oblivion” it meant that Sudha had forgotten to some abstract extent or everything because we never knew what was the limit of her forgetfulness. </p>
<p> Well, actually Sudha can’t forget anything because Sudha is an abstract concept in itself. We all are for ourselves and others. Sudha never knew anything because there was no Sudha. The mecahnism of body and brain and the indoctrination of self had created Sudha with some qualities, which was nothing more than an illusion. The memory wasn’t solely responsible. Perhaps everything was still there and she couldn’t just retreive it. That’d have been some other mechanism.</p>
<p> An incomplete thing cannot possess something complete.</p>



<h2> Completing ourselves...</h2>
<p> Is that the purpose of whole life? To complete and stabilize the change? Does nature hate change? Does nature finds itself to be the slave of change? </p>
<p> We all try to complete ourselves with the external support almost all the time. From mother to friends and then finding the partner. We never find ourselves or the body never finds itself complete until it ceases to exist. Can a partner complete you? Nay, how can an incomplete subject complete other incomplete subject. It can though make you feel complete for sometime until you’ll start missing something in yourself again. Getting in a bond with marriage? Can that complete the partners? That’s stupid because then why would they feel the need to have kids? Can 2 kids complete a family. Nay, again no limit of kids can complete you. No limit of partners or relationships or friends or anything else, even the knowledge cannot complete you, though it can boost the frustration and the misery of not getting completed even after your all endeavor. The void can never be filled.</p>


<h2> A fancy...</h2>
<p>It is a concept that drives the life and all universal forces. Yet it cannnot be achieved. It ends with belief or more than belief. Has anybody felt the ecstasy of being complete? Is there any such exquisite or splendid form which is complete and defies everything. Is independent of everything.  Is there anything better than the nature? Anything which is unlike nature free of everything?</p>
<p> There is a such thing and not to be found. It is everywhere, it is nowhere. We all are the poor deluded bastards, who can’t seem to find the thing which is in everything. The only complete thing is nothingness. The emptiness which you and I hold within ourselves. It isn’t the part that is trying to fill the void or trying to fill the void. IT IS THE VOID. The void is complete in itself and is unmutable unlike the mutable part. Can we really feel the complete void in ourselves and embrace it rather than being the slave of the non-void part which is vainly trying to fill the void?</p>


<h2> Conclusion...</h2>
<p>Language is the most interesting thing in the human sphere. It describes everything and yet cannot describe the littlest of the things. It is a pity, though. Can there be something more than language that can describe every aspect? The completeness is an abstract concept which is found nowhere but in the nothingness or emptiness. It is immutable and free of everything and is omnipresent. Humans cannot complete themselves, they may try it but in vain because it is always there yet not there. The 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or any number of anything be it friends, relatives, partners or children cannot complete a human. That doesn’t mean one should stop trying to look up for it. The effort counts, result doesn’t. We all unfortunately want the latter part. </p><hr>
