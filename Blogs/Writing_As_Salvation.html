<p>Note: Cioran didn’t mean it in the literal sense, I mean he meant but not really. A lot of his quotes and writings can be termed as a teen having mood swings. No doubt was a great pessimist with creativity but the quote just means that writing helps a lot in the bad times.</p> 


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I don’t think that Cioran found salvation in writing for nothing, it does help actually in subtle and even visible manners. Writing for the sake of writing, money or any other purpose is another thing but writing from the core of your heart actually helps in detaching yourself from the immediate surroundings and the physical world. It might help in spiritual progress too for it is also about focusing away from the physical world and devoting oneself for a single purpose that is writing. There blooms creativity from detachment and the profound emotions and feelings. Creativity also blooms from the strong feelings be it sadness, happiness, excitement, love or any other. Inner world is actually very quiet if you introspect and then contemplate your feelings the right way albeit there is no right way but still. The inner world finds peace in itself and defies the outer world once tamed.</p>


<h2>An Opinion... </h2>
<p>Writing seems like an escape from the world for many and that makes it spiritual too at times. Not always, though. The most difficult part in the case of writing lies in the noting down the innermost thoughts, feelings and experiences in short giving a structure to the feelings with the help of language. Giving these thoughts and feelings a poetic shape then makes it an art. Art that allures everyone. It actually seems like an art for the elites. Not in the typical sense of elites but elites of aesthetic world, people who can understand the art in an abstract form and in a profound manner. 
Now to talk about writing as salvation, we can have many evidences as well as experiences of ourselves and others. Cioran himself accepted that writng worked as salvation for him but he also admitted that writing was a tedious job and made him depressed, both contradict each other which makes it ambiguous to understand but to talk about people other than Cioran, it has helped many of them.</p>


<h2>My Experience...  </h2>
<p> My first experience with the writing was at very crucial time, when life was almost hanging on a fragile thread. The time when losing hope was in the daily routine, like a hobby. It did help but not with the cause rather with the frustration. </p>
<p>It helped in getting rid of nausea, a persistent one. Nausea which was related to the indigestion of the understanding the reality behind the reality. The time of anxiety is terrible and the analogy used pertains to it perfectly, and what generally makes you feel after the feeling of nausea? The vomiting helps, indeed and in the same manner writing down helps in feeling better.</p>

<h2>Writing as a hobby...</h2>
<p>Writing has become more than a hobby, it has become like a best friend.  It clears the entangled thoughts from mind and gives them a more straight shape just like entangled earphones. Both are difficult processes, straightening of entangled thoughts and as well as earphones. It is a tedious process but the result is of satisfaction. Writing as a hobby helps in introspecting as well as retrospecting. It helps in knowing the reality in a more real manner, helping in knowing the potential inside and the weaknesses making one fragile. Daily introspection with retrospection can give a clear idea of the possibilities in future and if there’s anything wrong going on in the presesnt. Writing is a great medium to share secrets with somebody without actually sharing with anyone. Not just secrets but also the dirtiest thoughts unacceptable in the society, from fiction to non-fiction writing provides a medium to explore one self and there’s no chance of betrayal or getting caught unless someone reads your work without permission. </p>

<h2>More to it...</h2>
<p>The best part after writing is reading in future and then contemplating and entertaining oneself with the thoughts of their younger self which once existed and are now lost in the fragments of time which are unretrievable but one can relive the memories by reading their own works. Differentiating between what they were and what they’ve become. Appreciating the efforts of their own younger self, appreciating the ways they used to tackle the hardships, how they trusted their pen and paper!</p>
<h2> Spirituality and writing...</h2>
<p>Writing is without any doubt a spiritual practice. It helps in connecting with the self and disintegrating the self from the hypocrisy of world. From the madness of the world to the madness of inner self. The journey is satisfactory. There is everything that any spiritual practice needs. It is a form of art, it requires devotion, it helps in understanding what one actually wants or if he wants anything at all. It helps in accepting the world the way it is without expecting much but at the same time makes one restless for a complete change or revolutian and that too occurs with the writing itself.</p> 

<h2> Conclusion...</h2>
<p>Writing is a difficult practice in the sense that it takes away something from you every time you write. That something is needed to get out but it leaves a trace of incompleteness which one might not like because that ‘thing’ had a place inside you. The emptiness persists for longer time and it does help in understanding the nature of world. </p>
<p>Writing works as a salvation for many, it has many advantages of its own for instance, getting rid of the undigested thoughts, entangled thoughts which cause anxiety that continues to deteriorate the mental health. As a spiritual practice it does work very well depending the purpose of writing.</p><hr>
