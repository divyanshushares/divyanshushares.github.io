<p><h3>“The great danger to the consumer is the monopoly -whether private or governmental. His most effective protection 
			  is free competition at home and free trade throughout the world. The consumer is protected from 
			  being exploited by one seller by the existence of another seller from whom he can buy and who is
			  eager to sell to him. Alternative sources of supply protect the consumer far more effectively than 
			  all the Ralph Naders of the world.”<h3><p>

<h2>Truth...</h2>
<p>Today’s market is filled with the capitalist tech giants who’ve monopolized the business and perhaps only because of the 
	lack of awareness and endeavor of an citizen. It is not about a specific country but majority of countries in the 
	world. This monopolizing not only creates lack of good changes but also creates a sphere of exploitation. Consumers 
	get exploited happily because they are adapted to it, sometimes unaware, kind of luddite and dislike the effort taken for the change. 

<h2> A single change...</h2>
<p>Almost a month ago I got introduced to an alternative for the operating system Windows. I was using Windows from the day 
	I got acquainted with the computers and laptops. I thought nothing was better than it and was reluctant for the change 
	because change needs an obvious effort. So I thought about shifting for sometime and then changed my operating system 
	from Windows to Mint distro of Linux. Only after a few days I found it much better than the Windows. It is customizable 
	to an extreme extent, is not magnet for viruses unlike Windows and these are the best things about it. Linux also 
	promotes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software"><i>FOSS</i></a>, so at first it didn’t just felt 
	amazing but it also inspired me to try to find out the alternatives for other things also. 

<h2>Know something...</h2>
<p>The monopoly is a curse for free market and the consumers. Sometimes we don’t give much attention to it and the one 
	suffering the consequences of it is also us. Microsoft monopolized the market by paying for making the laptops 
	and computers pre-installed with Windows. One has to pay for having the Windows. And monopolizing market by paying
	to manufacturers for providing pre-installed Windows has provided the company an abundant fortune. Some of us don’t 
	even get to know about the FOSS like Linux and other operating systems. Where I could’ve something better for free,
	I was paying for it. 
<p>It isn’t just about Windows but many other tech giants exploit their users. Take google for an instance. Google provide
	all services for free be it browser, youtube, mail, cloud drive and many other softwares. Isn’t that great? No, not 
	at all. Those aren’t free for nothing. Google, Meta and other tech giants are accused of selling the user data and
	using it for the intentional ad generating on their apps. Google was recently fined for creating hinderance in the
	free market by trying to monopolize the market. Meta also was accused of buying the companies in order to creaate the monopoly. 

<h2>Their Benefit... </h2>
<p>Monopoly benefits the companies to a large extent because of lack of awareness of the user of the alternative and getting
	used to the same company they exploit them in every manner. A common man thinks that his data is useless and companies
	can’t get any benefit and that’s where he is wrong and he becomes his own enemy. Can’t see himself in the shackles of
	the monopoly because he thought it was always like that.

<h2>A single spark is enough...</h2>
<p>So, just like any other day I was scrolling through YouTube and started feeling that it was really toxic.
	The algorithm of the YouTube in general is really toxic. In addition to that with every video I had
	to watch a 20 seconds ad and two to three 5 seconds ad. And if I wanted to get rid of those unwanted 
	ads then I had to buy premium. It really made me frustrated. I gave it a thought and YouTube actually
	worked as drug which induced dopamine. And other happy, sad and hate emotions. I was addicted to it perhaps.
	
<h2>A bigger change...</h2>
<p>So, a strong emotion of dislike made me take an effort against it. It started from giving up all the current apps 
	related to Google and my friend helped me in that. But still, there was a part in me afraid of not getting the
	same experience again. The process is weary yet satisfying in the end. My search engine changed from Google 
	to DuckDuckGo and browser from Chrome to FireFox. YouTube’s best alternative was algorithm and ad free LibreTube
	and Piped with more privacy and security just like the former DuckDuckGo and Firefox. Alternative for Google play
	store were ApkPure, ApkMirror and F-Droid. pCloud  replaced Google Drive. 
<p> Gmail’s alternative became Proton mail and Tutanota Mail. Changing Mail was the most weary process because I had to
	change the Mail id’s on the apps and websites which I often used and visited but eventually it ended well and 
	this one was the most exciting and best part of the new change. Just after finishing it I felt really satisfied.
	It was blissful. There was no unwanted data theft concern and it was more secure. Better at dealing with pop-ups and viruses. 

<h2> You can also change!</h2>
