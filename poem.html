			  <p>Cuckoo is like my happiness<p> 
<p>And spring shows its existence<p>
<p> But the time is of winter<p>
<p>Never ending winter<p>
<p> Or maybe I don't want it to end<p> 
<p>The winter has become cuckoo's pleasure<p>
<p>Spring may Come back<p>
<p>Cuckoo may show that it exists<p>
<p>But i resist spring<p>
<p>This winter will remain forever<p>
<p>Cuckoo will cease to exist<p>
<p>This winter will never end<p>

<p>there is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the average<p>
<p>human being to supply any given army on any given day<p>
<p>     <p><p>
<p>and the best at murder are those who preach against it<p>
<p>and the best at hate are those who preach love<p>
<p>and the best at war finally are those who preach peace<p>
<p>   <p>
<p>those who preach god, need god<p>
<p>those who preach peace do not have peace<p>
<p>those who preach peace do not have love<p>
<p>    <p>
<p>beware the preachers<p>
<p>beware the knowers<p>
<p>beware those who are always reading books<p>
<p>beware those who either detest poverty<p>
<p>or are proud of it<p>
<p>beware those quick to praise<p>
<p>for they need praise in return<p>
<p>beware those who are quick to censor<p>
<p>they are afraid of what they do not know<p>
<p>beware those who seek constant crowds for<p>
<p>they are nothing alone<p>
<p>beware the average man the average woman<p>
<p>beware their love, their love is average<p>
<p>seeks average<p>
<p>   <p>
<p>but there is genius in their hatred<p>
<p>there is enough genius in their hatred to kill you<p>
<p>to kill anybody<p>
<p>not wanting solitude<p>
<p>not understanding solitude<p>
<p>they will attempt to destroy anything<p>
<p>that differs from their own<p>
<p>not being able to create art<p>
<p>they will not understand art<p>
<p>they will consider their failure as creators<p>
<p>only as a failure of the world<p>
<p>not being able to love fully<p>
<p>they will believe your love incomplete<p>
<p>and then they will hate you<p>
<p>and their hatred will be perfect<p>
<p>    <p>
<p>like a shining diamond<p>
<p>like a knife<p>
<p>like a mountain<p>
<p>like a tiger<p>
<p>like hemlock<p>
<p>   <p>
<p>their finest art<p>
